    <h1>Motel Guest and JavaScript Objects</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the first section, I provide information about a motel customer using a customer object and template literal. In the second, I expand the assignment to provide information about two Motel Guests, swapping their information in two different anecdotes for staff gossip. I did this using classes and template literals. </p>

    <h2>Customer Description (motelObject)</h2>
    <div id="customer-info"></div>

    <h2>Hotel Staff Gossip (guestClass)</h2>
    <p>Here's some fun gossip between hotel staff about two guests!</p> 
    <p>There are two stories (from template literals) and two guests (instances of the motelGuest class). In the second version, I swapped the guest info while keeping the stories the same to demonstrate the value of classes. The paragraphs might not be perfect grammatically, but it was a fun exercise. For (fake) bonus points, I used AI to help create some extra methods, like formatted birthdate and mailing address, and to generate the stories. Information from the guests are bolded.</p>
